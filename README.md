# library-sync
A python program which syncs two directories such that it ensures the second is a copy of the first. I use this personally for syncing my PC's music library with my phone's music library.

This should work on python 3.x but I've only tested on python 3.6.0.

Try it yourself:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nficca/library-sync.sync && cd library-sync
$ python library-sync.py <master-directory> <copy-directory>
```
**Warning** - This is just something I am personally fiddling around with to ease the management of my music libraries. Don't flip out on me if you use this and things go wrong or don't work the way you'd expect. As such, **I recommend you to backup your files before using this.**
